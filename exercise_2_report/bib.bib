	abstract = {Objectives:
              To examine whether radiologists’ performances are consistent throughout a reading session and whether any changes in performance over the reading task differ depending on experience of the reader.
            
            
              Methods:
              The performance of ten radiologists reading a test set of 60 mammographic cases without breaks was assessed using an {ANOVA}, 2 × 3 factorial design. Participants were categorized as more (≥2,000 mammogram readings per year) or less (\&lt;2,000 readings per year) experienced. Three series of 20 cases were chosen to ensure comparable difficulty and presented in the same sequence to all readers. It usually takes around 30 min for a radiologist to complete each of the 20-case series, resulting in a total of 90 min for the 60 mammographic cases. The sensitivity, specificity, lesion sensitivity, and area under the {ROC} curve were calculated for each series. We hypothesized that the order in which a series was read (i.e. fixed-series sequence) would have a significant main effect on the participants’ performance. We also determined if significant interactions exist between the fixed-series sequence and radiologist experience.
            
            
              Results:
              Significant linear interactions were found between experience and the fixed sequence of the series for sensitivity (F[1] =5.762, p = .04, partial η  2 = .41) and lesion sensitivity. (F[1] =6.993, p = .03, partial η  2 = .46). The two groups’ mean scores were similar for the first series but progressively diverged. By the end of the third series, significant differences in sensitivity and lesion sensitivity were evident, with the more experienced individuals demonstrating improving and the less experienced declining performance. Neither experience nor series sequence significantly affected the specificity or the area under the {ROC} curve.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Radiologists’ performance may change considerably during a reading session, apparently as a function of experience, with less experienced radiologists declining in sensitivity and lesion sensitivity while more experienced radiologists actually improve. With the increasing demands on radiologists to undertake high-volume reporting, we suggest that junior radiologists be made aware of possible sensitivity and lesion sensitivity deterioration over time so they can schedule breaks during continuous reading sessions that are appropriate to them, rather than try to emulate their more experienced colleagues.
            
            
              Advances in knowledge:
              Less-experienced radiologists demonstrated a reduction in mammographic diagnostic accuracy in later stages of the reporting sessions. This may suggest that extending the duration of reporting sessions to compensate for increasing workloads may not represent the optimal solution for less-experienced radiologists.},

	abstract = {Objective:
              We examined the impact task interruptions of differing qualitative and quantitative load have on visuospatial vigilance sensitivity.
            
            
              Background:
              The vigilance decrement and attempts to develop countermeasures to the decrement is one of the most important human factors issues. There is an ongoing debate between those who interpret the increase in the rate of failures to detect signals over time as being due to objective task monotony or task underload and those who interpret this increased failure proneness as being predominately due to cognitive-resource depletion and task overload.
            
            
              Method:
              Participants were assigned at random to one of six interruptions: Participants were given a complete rest (rest); participants completed a 1-back verbal working-memory ({WM}) task, a 3-back verbal {WM} task, a 1-back spatial {WM} task, or a 3-back spatial {WM} task; or participants performed the primary vigilance task (continuous).
            
            
              Results:
              Postinterruption performance was best for rest and worst for continuous. A resource theory perspective led us to make two possible predictions of relative interruption effect orders of the six conditions out of 720 possible orderings. We found one of the two orders.
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Overall, the vigilance sensitivity decrement appears to be due to the recurring use of particular cognitive resources, and resource theorists should explore this more extensively in the future.
            
            
              Application:
              Countermeasures for the vigilance decrement should be based on clear cognitive-resource considerations. Rest is the best countermeasure. Intervening tasks should be chosen that minimize resource-demand overlap with the vigilance task.},
